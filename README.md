## 🧭 Onboarding Guide

If you're new to Kafka-Gov, we recommend the following onboarding path.

1. **Choose your mode**
   - Just want to try the UI and features quickly → **Lite Mode (SQLite)**
   - Running a team PoC or a more production-like environment → **Full Stack Mode (Docker + MySQL)**

2. **Prepare your environment**
   - Lite Mode:
     - Install Python 3.12+ and [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)
     - If you do not set any DB-related values in `.env`, Kafka-Gov will automatically use SQLite
   - Full Stack Mode:
     - Install Docker / Docker Compose
     - Optionally adjust Kafka/Schema Registry settings in `.env` for your environment

3. **Configure the metadata database**
   - Default: when nothing is configured, `sqlite+aiosqlite:///./kafka_gov.db` is used
   - MySQL example:
     ```bash
     KAFKA_GOV_DATABASE_URL=mysql+aiomysql://user:password@mysql:3306/kafka_gov?charset=utf8mb4
     ```
   - PostgreSQL example:
     ```bash
     KAFKA_GOV_DATABASE_URL=postgresql+asyncpg://user:password@postgres:5432/kafka_gov
     ```

4. **Run migrations**
   - Alembic always uses `settings.database.url`, so as long as the URL is correct, migrations target the right DB.
   - Local (Lite Mode) example (recommended):
     ```bash
     bash script/migrate.sh
     # or, if executable
     ./script/migrate.sh
     ```
   - Advanced (run Alembic directly):
     ```bash
     uv run alembic upgrade head
     ```
   - In Docker environments, the `migration` service included in `docker-compose.yml` is responsible for running migrations.

5. **Open the UI and register your first connections**
   - Open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser
   - Register Kafka Cluster / Schema Registry connections directly through the UI
   - From then on, all governance metadata is stored in the selected DB (SQLite/MySQL/Postgres)

After onboarding, see [Quick Start](./docs/getting-started/quick-start.md) and
[Configuration](./docs/getting-started/configuration.md) for more details.

## 🌟 What is Kafka-Gov?

Kafka-Gov transforms Kafka from a simple message broker into a **governed enterprise platform** with:

- **🏷️ Rich Metadata**: Owner, team, tags, documentation links for every topic
- **🛡️ Policy Enforcement**: Environment-specific rules (naming, replication, ISR)
- **🚀 Batch Operations**: YAML-based bulk create/update/delete with dry-run
- **📦 Schema Management**: Integrated Schema Registry with auto-correlation
- **📊 Real-time Monitoring**: Consumer lag, fairness index, stuck partition detection
- **📝 Complete Audit Trail**: Track every change (who, when, what, why)

## 💡 Why Kafka-Gov?

| Traditional Tools | Kafka-Gov |
|-------------------|-----------|
| ❌ No ownership tracking | ✅ Mandatory owner, team, tags |
| ❌ No policy enforcement | ✅ Environment-specific validation |
| ❌ Manual one-by-one operations | ✅ YAML-based batch operations |
| ❌ No audit trail | ✅ Complete change history |
| ❌ Separate schema tool | ✅ Integrated schema management |

 **Problems we solve:**
 - 🤔 **Who owns this topic?** → Track ownership across hundreds of topics
 - 📝 **What is it for?** → Required documentation links
 - ⚠️ **Policy violations?** → Auto-detect risky configs before deployment
 - 🚀 **Bulk operations?** → Create 50+ topics in one YAML file
 - 🔄 **Change history?** → Complete audit trail with before/after snapshots

### 프로젝트 방향성

Although we initially approached this project from a governance perspective, over time it started to drift toward operational concerns. To realign with its original direction — governance — we are refocusing on **topics** and **scenario-based policy alerts** as the core of the project.

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

Kafka-Gov supports **Airflow-style metadata DB switching**.

### 1) Lite Mode (SQLite, no Docker required)

For local development or quick evaluation, Kafka-Gov uses a SQLite file as the metadata store.

```bash
# 1. Clone and setup
git clone https://github.com/limhaneul12/kafka-gov.git
cd kafka-gov
cp .env.example .env

# 2. (optional) If you do not set any DB env vars, SQLite is used by default
#    When KAFKA_GOV_DATABASE_URL is unset, ./kafka_gov.db is created/used automatically

# 3. Install dependencies
uv sync

# 4. Run DB migrations (uses settings.database.url → default SQLite)
bash script/migrate.sh

# 5. Start backend API
uv run uvicorn app.main:app --reload

# 6. (optional) Start frontend (from ./frontend)
# pnpm install
# pnpm dev
```

In this mode, the **local file `./kafka_gov.db`** is used as the metadata database.

### 2) Full Stack Mode (Docker Compose + MySQL)

For production-like setups, use Docker Compose to start MySQL/Kafka/Schema Registry/Redis together.

```bash
# 1. Clone and setup
git clone https://github.com/limhaneul12/kafka-gov.git
cd kafka-gov
cp .env.example .env

# 2. Start all services (includes MySQL-backed metadata DB)
docker-compose up -d

# 3. Access web UI (proxied by nginx)
open http://localhost:8000
```

**That's it!** 🎉

See [Quick Start Guide](./docs/getting-started/quick-start.md) for more details.

## ✨ Features

### 🏷️ Rich Topic Metadata

Every topic includes owner, team, documentation URL, and custom tags:

```yaml
name: prod.orders.created
metadata:
  owner: team-commerce
  doc: "https://wiki.company.com/orders"
  tags: ["orders", "critical", "pii"]
```

### 🚀 YAML-Based Batch Operations

Create dozens of topics at once:

```yaml
kind: TopicBatch
env: prod
items:
  - name: prod.orders.created
    action: create
    config:
      partitions: 12
      replication_factor: 3
```

Upload → Review dry-run → Apply changes

</div>

### 🛡️ Policy Enforcement

Environment-specific rules prevent production incidents:

| Policy | DEV | PROD |
|--------|-----|------|
| Min Replication | ≥ 1 | ≥ 3 ⚠️ |
| Min ISR | ≥ 1 | ≥ 2 ⚠️ |
| 'tmp' prefix | ✅ | 🚫 |

### �️ Schema Governance (New)

Advanced schema quality control and life-cycle management:

- **📊 Governance Dashboard**: Real-time health scoring based on compatibility, documentation, and linting quality.
- **🛡️ Custom Guardrails**: Define your own linting rules and environment-specific compliance policies (e.g., mandatory 'doc' fields, forbidden naming patterns).
- **🕒 Schema Time Machine**: Complete history of every schema version with 1-click rollback plans.
- **📈 Impact Analysis**: Visual graph showing which topics and consumers are affected by a schema change.

</div>

### 📊 Real-time Monitoring

- **Consumer lag tracking** with p50/p95/max metrics
- **Fairness index** (Gini coefficient) for partition distribution
- **Stuck partition detection** with configurable thresholds
- **Rebalance stability** scoring with time windows
- **WebSocket streaming** for live updates
